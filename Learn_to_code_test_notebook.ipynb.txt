    "- you installed the wrong version of Anaconda;\n",
    "- you installed the wrong variant of Anaconda (there is the same version of Anaconda both for Python 3 and Python 2); \n",
    "- during the installation you decided to keep your existing Python installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see which software versions you have installed, click on the 'Help' menu above, and then on the 'About' option. You should have Python version 3.4.3, Anaconda version 2.3.0 and IPython (also known as Jupyter) notebooks version 3.2.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "If not, make a note of which versions you have and ask for help on the [installation instruction page](http://www.open.edu/openlearn/learn-to-code-installation)."
